# NeuralNetworksInPython
I have designed these neural networks to revise the mathematics involved in their training, I have derived by hand all of the backprop and learning equations. These neural networks may not be the most efficient but, efficiency was not the aim here. The aim here was understanding. The various networks contained include a Rosenblatt Perceptron, a single layer sigmoid neuron, a custom multi-layered perceptron and a specific version of RNN.
